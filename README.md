# Predictive-Modeling-Approach-for-Employee-Salaries-Estimations-Based-on-Linear-Regression-Analysis
In this notebook we will explore the linear regression model for learning predictive modeling. Linear Regression is a very simple machine learning algorithm for finding the relationship between two continuous variables.  In this repository, we have determined the linear relationship between the numbers of years experience of the employee in the company and the salary of an employee in the current time.
